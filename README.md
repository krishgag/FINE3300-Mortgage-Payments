In this code, I define a class that calculates mortgage payments by converting a quoted semi-annually compounded interest rate into an effective periodic rate for various payment frequencies and then computing the corresponding payment amounts using the present value of an annuity formula. I then gather user inputs for the principal, rate, and amortization period, calculate both standard and accelerated payments (rounding the results to two decimal places), and print these values to the screen.
